# Lance-A-Lot
**NOTE:** *Lance-a-lot is a fictious website created for my first Milestone project for The Code Institute.*

Lance-a-lot is a new online freelance company that targets coders of all experiences and pairs them with web development jobs that are posted by indiviuals
or businesses. The idea behind the company is to create a secure online workplace, where clients can post a job,
browse potential coders for said job and also pay through the website. The coders can also see a job and enquire about working on it.

## UX

While researching websites of a similar concept I had found that a few of them felt overloaded with text or images, unattractive colour schemes,
poor layout of the sites purpose, for example; excessive scrolling to find what the site is advertised for. I had also spotted on a small number of these sites the
responsive design was quite poor and it didn't translate well onto my mobiles browser e.g. no breathing room for text, zoomed in images and also the need to side scroll 
to see the full content.

### User Stories

> - Joe 

>  As a coder I want a website I can sign up to and browse and choose avaliable projects that I want to work on
> - Patrick

>  I want a website that is easy to navigate and be able hire numerous coders to work together as a team
> - Caoimhe

> I want a website that I can use on my mobile that looks like it was designed for mobile users
> - Sean

    

### Strategy

The aim of my project is to attract coders and businesses to join this website. I plan on doing so with a simple and user-friendly UX and keeping the steps to reach their objective to a minimum.

  - Project Goals
    - Have new coders and businesses sign up
    - Making the join us process straight forward and seem effortless, I'll achieve this by having just enough information displayed so they can quickly understand the purpose of the website and how to hire coders and post jobs.
    - Keeping the site UI looking clean and not overloaded with information that may distract the user and provide a bad UX.
    
  - User Goals
    - A navigation bar so the user can navigate easily.
    - The information on each section is long enough to understand the content but also short enough that they don't feel overwhelmed
    - Small profile windows of coders so clients can browse potential skill sets of many different developers.
    - A mobile first designed site as some users wish to be able to use this on their phones.
    - CTA buttons on most sections to get the user signed up as quickly as possible.
    - A free site to sign up and doesn't require a membership fee or any fee to post a job.
  
### Scope

 When planning the approach on how to design this site I decided a Minimalist Web Design (MWD) was the best style.
 
  - Keeps away potential distractions and will insure a clean UX.
  - Suits my current coding level.
  - Easier to find the content the user is looking for and navigate.
  
### Structure

- The main target of this structure is to allow the user to quickly and easily find the info they need and to sign up.
- A brief heading on each section with a small paragraph, subtitle or images explaining the section the user is on.
- A navigation bar for easy navigation when scrolling to the bottom of the page.
- The landing page that will Welcome the user and give a brief introduction about the website.
- A section Explaining how the website works.
- A small selection of currently available coders ready and their skill sets.
- A section showing the user a few of the previous completed projects by the freelancers so the user can seen what can be achieved.
- CTA buttons on most sections to get the user to sign up quick and easily or to contact us directly.
- A join us Modal on the index.html too keep the user on the same url so they dont feel like they're being sent somewhere else.
- A contact us page that will have a short form to fill out, an email address for contacting the support team and an address for the office building.
- A Terms and Conditions page that will have the T&C's of the website.

- How it works, Freelancers, previous projects sections, a Join Us modal, Contact Us page and a Terms and Conditions page 

- A navigation bar with styles so the user knows what page they're on.

- A small section with a heading and some brief info about the site.

- A footer a the bottom of the page with a copyright stamp and link to terms and conditions.

- Top priorty for this site:
  - The layout for each section to be simple and to the point.
  - A navigation bar.
  - The brief information about the section the user is on so after reading or viewing the section the user knows what they're looking at.
  - Working links to bring the user where they need to be.
  - Footer at the bottom of the page which can be seen by scrolling down
